[FYI] Why we don't support direct upload and conversion of FLV videos

The simple answer is that we do not have MONEY:'( 

A tool you need to know: [b]ffmpeg[/b]: [url]http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/[/url]

To support a ffmpeg flv webhosting needs MONEY (it requires from $200 to $1000 per month), since it requires high CPU usage.

We really need your support NOW to convert and upload your firsttimer video to FirstTimer.ca, once we have enough users and videos, we will look forward to renting a high quality server to support all the features a video sharing website needs to have! [color=Red][b]Please Help! Thanks a lot! [/b][/color]:victory: :handshake 

What do you think of the ideas of this website?
We want to start a company to implement our firsttimer website idea. Do you guys think it will success? Really need to hear from you! Thanks a lot! 

ffmpeg -i test.mpg -ab 56 -ar 22050 -b 500 -r 15 -s 320x240 test.flv

[FYI] How to create a FLV video thumb

INTRO: A video thumb is a picture captured from your video. It could be at any time frame of the video.

A tool you need to know: [b]ffmpeg[/b]: [url]http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/[/url]

Q: Why we need to upload video thumb ourselves?
A: To support a ffmpeg webhosting needs MONEY, currently we are using a free webhosting for this website which does not support [b]ffmpeg[/b] (since it requies high CPU usage).

Q: How to generate a thumb from your FLV video?
A: I have windows version binary build of ffmpeg avaiable here for you guys to download: [url]http://tianye.110mb.com/tools/ffmpeg.zip[/url]
Copy it to the folder where your FLV video is located, and execute the following command in the windows CMD:
[b]ffmpeg -i "videofilename.flv" -y -f image2 -ss 8 -t 0.001 -s 350x240 "thumbname.jpg(or gif)"[/b]

check out the ffmpeg doc webpage: [url]http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg-doc.html[/url] or just type "[b]ffmpeg[/b]" in your windows CMD to show all the ffmpeg options.

There is also a small and neat windows GUI application that is easily to use for generating thumbs from videos: [url]http://www.im-research.org/im-flv-thumbnail[/url] however, if you just use the "DEMO" version, there will be an ad banner in between of the thumb being generated from your video.

Once again, I appreciate your support of taking these steps to upload your videos. Your videos is critical to the success of this website. Once we are in a "shape", we will switch to a web hosting that fully support video stream features. Thanks a lot!:handshake :hug:
